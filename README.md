# vf-cis-cms-df-pg-sftp-delta

SFTP Delta
=========================

Contains plugins to perform code from a SFTP server to GCS, and from GCS to SFTP.
Uses a delta file to control uploading of files that have already been uploaded.

Blocks must work together:

    - SFTPDelta + SFTPtoGCS
    - GCSDelta + GCStoSFTP

Source Delta blocks read the files from the source and output a list of files that meet the delta condition.

Sink blocks upload files to destination.

It is recomended use a repartition plugin between source and sink.

*Output from source blocks is not the content of the readed files, is a list of files.*


Build
-----
To build this plugin:

```
   mvn clean package
```

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/sftpdelta-<version>.jar config-file <target/sftpdelta-<version>.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'sftpdelta-<version>':

    > load artifact target/sftpdelta-<version>.jar config-file target/sftpdelta-<version>.json
